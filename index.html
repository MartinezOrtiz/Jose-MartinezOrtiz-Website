        <br>I started my education experience in Mexico. I studied in Mexico during my K-5 education. Later, I moved to the United States in 6th grade and learned a new language. I studied in the state of Texas where I was able to learn a second language (English) and was introduced to a new culture and traditions. During my time in Texas I concentrated on learning English and learning the subject areas in middle school. It was a difficult time, but with the help of my teachers, friends, and family I was able to accomplish my academic goals during that time. My teachers helped me adapt to this new culture. During my two years in texas I was able to obtain a good knowledge of the English language to the point where I was able to understand most of the things that my teachers were saying and have conversations with teachers and other students. I consider this two years as being fundamental to my academic and professional goals because it allowed me to learn a new language and a new culture.  
 I moved to Oklahoma after two years of studying in Texas. I moved to a small town called Guymon. In this town I completed my middle school education and completed two years of my high school education. During this time I took courses such as financial literacy that allowed me to obtain basic knowledge of many financial issues such as how to manage a bank account, how to administer income, and how the stock market works. Furthermore, during this time I also mastered the use of the English language and began to go on my own without any help. I also took spanish courses that help me understand my native language more deeply and allowed me to see how different cultures connect and how they have differences but also many similarities. I was able to work in many group projects that allowed me to develop skills to socialize and collaborate with others. I was able to share ideas with other students and teachers on school subjects. I won awards for academic achievements and in many subject areas.  I consider these years a fundamental part of my educational and professional development.  
I moved to Moreno Valley California three years of studying in guymon Oklahoma. During this time I completed my last two years of high school education and continued to college where I am currently in my fourth year of college at the University of California Riverside. During this time I was able to work as a TA with teachers in high school where I acquire knowledge on how to run a classroom setting. I graduated with honors with a GPA over 4.0. I entered into UCR and have been working on my bachelors with a Spanish Major. During this time I have been doing research and focusing on classes that would give me skills for my professional goals. I have been working on projects with teachers and students that have given me the knowledge to collaborate with other people and find ways to approach different kind of issues. I have been taking a variety of classes that are preparing me for life after college and that have given me experience in subjects such as Math, Education, Spanish, Computer Science, Psychology, Ehnic Studies, History, Anthropology, Geology, English, and many others. All of these parts of my professional have and continue preparing me in my professional activities.
